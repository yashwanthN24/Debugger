# Debugger

# What is a debugger ?

- Debugger is really a tool to help you to look at whats going on in your program

- Usually people do print debugging by trying to print things up to see what is happening
- This Printing Technique is good for small programs and small code 

- But when you have a large codeBase Always use "Debugger"

- A breakpoint essentially means that i want to stop  , pause and have a look at whats going on at this point of time on that line
- Three main tools to know
  1) Step Over - goes to next line (Moves to next line of the code)
  3) Step Into - To go into the execution of that line
  4) Step Out  = steps/takes out of the current scope (brings you out of current scope) (Like from the place where that function was called)
  5) Continue = Takes to the next breakpoint directly
 
- You can use the watch tab inside the debugger to watch only specific part like nums[:5] only want to see a slice of array nums
- Place breakpoint essentially where you want to see snapshot of whats happening in your code

- Use step out when you want to come out of that function (or directly the end of function return statement)
